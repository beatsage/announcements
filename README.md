# ðŸ›¸ BeatSaver arrives!

You may now upload levels from Beat Sage to [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com)! We worked with the folks at BeatSaver to make this happen and are excited about the new possibilities. Once you upload a Beat Sage map to BeatSaver, you may:

- Use the "!bsr ðŸ”‘" command to watch your favorite Beat Saber streamers play your favorite song!
- Use [BeatSync](https://bsaber.com/beatsync/) to install levels from BeatSaver with one click!

## ðŸŽ¶ More songs!

We added support for level creation from several new websites and audio file formats. In addition to YouTube, try pasting a link from ***TikTok***, ***Bandcamp***, ***Mixcloud***, ***Beatport***, or even ***Dropbox*** and ***Google Drive*** (note that subscription services like Spotify will not work). In addition to MP3, we now support ***AAC***, ***AIFF***, ***OGG***, ***FLAC***, and ***WAV*** files. We hope this makes it easier than ever to play Beat Saber to your favorite songs!
