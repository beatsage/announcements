# Updates

Welcome to **Beat Sage v2**! In this update, we've released three new experimental features ðŸ§ª: **One Saber Levels**, **90 Degree Levels**, and **Obstacles (Walls)**! Thanks to all of you who **[supported us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/beatsage)** to make this happen ðŸ’Ÿ.

We trained a new AI to build these features, and as such generated levels will be different for all modes including Standard. We feel that **the new model (v2) has better overall flow** than the older model. If you prefer, **the old model (v1) is still accessible** from our new "Advanced Settings" menu (Step 5).

We've also added a few additional features to this update. You can now **add custom album art** to be displayed in game. You can also **choose your favorite Beat Saber environment**. Prior to this update, Beat Sage would always generate the same level for a given song. We've removed this restriction and it is now possible to **generate as many levels as you like for your favorite songs**!

We hope you enjoy these additions! Blessings on your Beat Journey.
